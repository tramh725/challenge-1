# Challenge 1: CrowdFunding Book

In this challenge, I used a series of functions from Excel in order to gather all the datas that I needed in order to make my analysis regarding the effectiveness of CrowdFunding.
There are six sheets total at the bottom, with "CrowdFunding" being the main sheet. In this sheet, I've used many formulas that was taught by my instructor, Hugo Ramos, in order to calculate the Percentage Funded, Outcome, Average Donation. In addition to those formulas, he also presented how to use Pivot table, split a column, as well as adding graphs. Besides Hugo, I received help on how to convert Unix timestamp into a normal timestamp from this a website[1]. Then, on the "Statistical Analysis" sheet, I've also received help on how to filter the columns [2].
